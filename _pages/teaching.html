<h3>PIC 16B (Spring 2023 - Winter 2026) Python with Applications II</h3>
Teaching Assistant: wrote discussion materials, led discussion sessions, evaluated student projects.

I've been fortunate to be the sole TA for PIC 16B at UCLA for the past three years. Over that time, I've developed and refined a set of programming activities that I'm happy with for getting students comfortable with topics like APIs, web scraping, PyTorch, and plotly, while also giving them practice with less-structured, exploratory problem solving. Once students get comfortable with this kind of problem solving, I've seen some incredible progress over the course of a quarter.

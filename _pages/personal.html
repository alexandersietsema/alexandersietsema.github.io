Outside of mathematics, I like to play Ultimate frisbee, roller hockey, escape rooms, and Euchre. I also enjoy hiking, cooking, and watching/complaining about college football-- Go Blue!

Below are a few pictures and other points of interest.

<h3>Roller Hockey</h3>
In high school I played in the school ball hockey league, and continued playing pickup in East Lansing into college where I began goaltending. In Los Angeles, I play league roller hockey in Mar Vista a couple nights a week. Eventually I'd like to start collecting game statistics which may end up here in the future.

<h3>Ultimate Frisbee</h3>
I started playing ultimate seriously my senior year of high school when I was the captain of our team that went to the state championship. At Michigan State, I organized a math pickup ultimate group, and continued this to UCLA, where in addition to department pickup we also have a department IM team (the Whitney Disc Trick). I also play in the LAOut recreational leagues, and hope to keep playing as much as I can!

<h3>Escape Rooms</h3>
<br>
I play and review escape rooms with my friend <a href="https://bradenhanks.weebly.com">Braden Hanks</a>-- we've played over 120 in Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Check out our tier list below!

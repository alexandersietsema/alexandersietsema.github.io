I am a third year applied mathematics Ph.D. candidate at UCLA advised by Deanna Needell. My main research interests are in numerical linear algebra, optimization, and machine learning. I have also done research on topics in X-ray CT tomography, quantum computing, game theory, and sports analytics. See the [Research](https://alexandersietsema.github.io/research/) section for more details.

Before starting at UCLA, I received a B.S. in Advanced Mathematics and a B.S. in Computational Mathematics from Michigan State University. I also grew up in East Lansing. See the [Personal](https://alexandersietsema.github.io/personal/) section for more details.

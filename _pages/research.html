I am a member of the Dr. Saiprasad Ravishankar's <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/slimgroup/">Signals, Learning, and Imaging Group</a> at MSU. My area of study has been mainly on descattering and density reconstruction techniques for X-ray CT imaging. In particular, we have looked at the performance of locally-learned scatter models for particle simulation data, as well as comparisons of one-step and two-step optimization techniques for these problems. The latter topic led to <a href="https://alexandersietsema.github.io/publication/2021-one-step">this paper</a>. I am currently starting work on Gaussian processes for compressed sensing problems.

<h2> Sports Rankings </h2>
<p><figure style="float: left; margin-right:50px; width:35%"><img src="../images/ultimate_rankings.png"></figure>
I'm incredibly bitter about the College Football Playoff, and naturally think a lot about better ways to rank sports teams. As part of the Kaczmarz projects we discussed the least squares rating method, and it occurred to me that it would be particularly appropriate for Ultimate frisbee which led to the preparation of <a href="link">this paper</a>. Other ongoing interests in this area include covariance estimation methods for sports data for use in weighted or generalized least squares settings, as well as other maximum likelihood techniques for rankings.</p>

<h2> Kaczmarz Methods </h2>
<p><figure style="float: right; margin-left:50px; width:35%"><img src="../images/kaczmarz.png"></figure>
In the summer of 2021 I was able to participate in the UCLA Computational and Applied Mathematics REU in which we studied Kaczmarz methods. We are interested in all sorts of Kaczmarz-type methods and applications, but especially in coming up with weighting or sampling methods for extended Kaczmarz methods which may either improve convergence results or change the type of convergence achieved.</p>

<h2> Two Point Conversions </h2>
<p><figure style="float: left; margin-right:50px; width:35%"><img src="../images/tpt.png"></figure>
I've always been a rather aggressively-minded college football fan, especially when it comes to two point conversions. I came across an approach by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09332480.2000.10542218">Sackrowitz (2000)</a> which matched up with my intuition and I have been working on extending it. The main idea is to treat the effect of the point-after-touchdown decision as a decision tree: after a touchdown, a team can decide to either go for two or kick an extra point, each of which creates different scenarios with different success rates. With certain assumptions, this tree can be backpropagated to come up with win probabilities for a given decision. This approach (Sackrowitz's) assumes that a coach know exactly how many drives are remaining. If this isn't known, what is the best choice? I am trying to answer this question using data-driven models (see left), as well as potentially include more decisions in the calculation.</p>

<h2> Quantum Computing </h2>
<p>I am also a member of Dr. Daniel Appelo's <a href="https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/danielappelo">Appelo High Order Group</a>. Currently, we are working on machine learning tools for quantum computing applications.</p>
